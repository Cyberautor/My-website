       <h2>Projects Background.</h2>
       <h1>After-school project</h1>
       <p> Our after-school sessions offer a range of services including academic tutoring, psycho-social support, career guidance, and lots more. 
        Volunteers work in small groups (ratio 1:10) and our learners drive the agenda by bringing work they are struggling with to the tutoring sessions. The small groups enable vital individual attention and fast feedback. It is through this learner-centric approach that the learners can be able to fill the gaps in their knowledge and strengthen their grasp on fundamental conceptual basics.
